This is a DC/Northern Virginia/Southern Maryland Urbit discussion group.

It is for Urbit users or the urbit-curious or people who like to think and talk about decentralization, independence, and freedom on the internet.

We will socialize, discuss urbit and related topics, and support lab and learning activities.
