## Description

%gora was a much beloved Urbit app that allowed NFT tokens to be awarded to Urbit ships. The uses for this are manifold - you can give proofs of attendance for an event, show membership in a group, award a badge to prove you completed a course, give a unique digital prize, etc.

However, since the departure of ~rabsef-bicrym the original %gora app has been unmaintained and is currently unusable. The Urbit community needs %gora to be up and running.


## Milestone 1

ETA: November 2024

Payment: 1 stars

Get %gora working and keep it working for a period of 6 months, including keeping up with any kelvin updates.
