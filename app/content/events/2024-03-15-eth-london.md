Dear ETHLondon,

​We're hosting a very special event delving beyond 'just narrative', into the worlds of AI and Personal Computing.

This event will be light on content and heavy on curating the right people.

​Drinks on tap, food ready to go, all you have to do is turn up (And not be burnt out from the week's networking and activities).

The future of Compute & Intelligence is coming into it's own technological hayday. Entire P2P systems of Compute and entire decentralised networks of AI are not only possible, they're real, real today.

​A testimonial from our previous event:

> ​I didn't know if I was walking into a crack den or the future of humanity. I still don't know. In fact, I think my mind was erased using secret CIA technology and was then used as a vehicle to gang stalk dark site targets.

  > Wait, what did you want again, a testimonial?

 > Ah yeah, these guys throw THE BEST events...

Hosted by Bittensor and Urbit.
