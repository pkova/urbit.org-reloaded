A social gathering for the New England Urbit Community! This will be an open-ended and casual afternoon where you can shoot the breeze on a warm summer day. Feel free to show up and meet other people that share your interest in Martian life. Though there are no planned topics, conversations will probably cover programming, happenings in the Urbit community, and wider cultural interests. 

If necessary, there will be on-boarding assistance to help newcomers join the network, so feel free to bring a non-Martian friend! The host will have packets that explain the Urbit OS and network in detail.

The Urban Park rooftop garden contains ample seating and a pickleball court.
