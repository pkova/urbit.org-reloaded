Urbit Foundation is excited to announce the **2024 Urbit Developer Summit.** This year’s Summit is being held in the deep south at a beautiful venue on Lake Lanier just an hour's drive from Atlanta International Airport. We'll have a sprawling lakeside compound for four days with access to a pool, hot tub, volleyball court, fire pit, and a boat. **Lake Summit** is aimed at Urbit Developers, and will be an opportunity to share what we've all been working on, hack together IRL, and brainstorm.

## The Details

Lake Summit will take place from **Monday, June 17th** through **Friday, June 22nd.** The opening event begins at 4pm on Monday and ends with a closing party on Thursday night.

**Tickets cost $400.** Financial support scholarships are available.

If you are interested in joining us at Lake Summit, we encourage you to submit an application using the [form](https://forms.gle/Kr2Fg5YUBdNPK5DT8)

Lake Summit is a developer-focused event. If you have been working on something that you're excited about, we'd love for you to share this with the developer community. If you would like to give a talk / workshop, please mention this in the [form](https://forms.gle/Kr2Fg5YUBdNPK5DT8)

## Travel

You will need to organise your own travel between Lake Lanier and Atlanta airport (an Uber should cost around $120). You will also need to arrange for travel between your accommodations and the venue each day. We recommend using Uber or a rental car. There is ample parking space at the venue. 

## Hope to see you there!
