What’s the internet without friends?

Pals is a building block for a whole suite of apps, and thus showcases one of Urbit’s most exciting features: composability.

To use Pals, simply add other Urbit users whom you already know, or accept incoming requests from users who wish to pal you. You can also give those users tags like “nyc” or “devs” or “family.”

Now any app can interact with pals and use your list for its own purpose. For instance within Tlon’s Groups, a smiley face shows up next to a user who is already your pal.

Other apps within the Pals suite are Face, Contacts, and Rumors. We expect many other apps will make use of Pals in the future. So get to it and start making friends!
