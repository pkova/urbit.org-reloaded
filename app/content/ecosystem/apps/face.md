On Urbit, you don’t have to share your photos with just anybody. Upload a photo of yourself and then curate who you’ll allow to see it using Pals. Just make sure to upload your most dapper photo and voila. Now when someone spies you out of the corner of their eye at the next great Urbit event, they’ll know just who they’re talking to.
