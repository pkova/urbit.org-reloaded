Trill is a micro-blogging platform on Urbit. Itâ€™s a simple proposition with some highly interesting consequences. For one thing, the app is composable with other apps. So you can import your list of Urbit pals. It also means that your feed is not being fine-tuned by a massive corporation trying to nudge you in the direction of advertisements. This way you can check up on what your friends are thinking, and avoid the spammers, ads, and copypasta content. So let those posts sing.
