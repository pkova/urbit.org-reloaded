Remember the days of turning on the radio in a car full of friends and jamming out to whatever happens to be on the dial? Those days donâ€™t have to be dead and gone. Radio allows you to browse the YouTube channels other Urbit users are watching and chat with them in real-time. It takes a public good (YouTube) and turns it into a digitally networked clubhouse. Rock on!
