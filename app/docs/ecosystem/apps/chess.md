“The ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life.”  
—Paul Morphy, Grandmaster

Now’s the time to become a gentleman. Or, perhaps if you’re not careful, to waste your life. In either case, you can now play the beautiful game entirely peer-to-peer. Challenge your friends, play against yourself (no doubt you’re your own toughest opponent), or simply analyze different positions. It’s time to play chess on Urbit.
